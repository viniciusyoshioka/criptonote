# CriptoNote

Notepad app that encrypts notes and files

## Platform

Currently, only Android is supported

## About the application

### Ideia

This app was created when I started studying React Native. I wanted to create a simple application, but with some differential, because I didn't want to develop the same TODO App every tutorial teaches. Then, the idea I had was a notepad app. And for the differential, it could encrypt the notes to secure the content.

### Security

The idea to encrypt notes content on user device may not be conventional. However, I considered the safest implementation due to a few reasons.

- Passwords are not stored;
- Offline usage ensure nothing leaves the device;
- Event if someone have physical access to the device, they won't have access to the content;
